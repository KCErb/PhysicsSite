## The Physics Site

This is the source for physics.utah.edu/~kcerb.

I'm of course using git to version control my site (because it's fun and I need the practice) but why put it on github?

I don't know! Maybe I'll need to show how this site works to someone else and then this will make it super easy!

**But why not just make a github site?**

Well, I'll do that eventually, but while I'm a grad student at UofU it's fun to have an official looking domain.

The downside is that I have to use FileZilla to copy all my files over to the school's machine, but that's OK. I'm learning from that too!
